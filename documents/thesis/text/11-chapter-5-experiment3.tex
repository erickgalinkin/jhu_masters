\chapter{Experiment 3 - Dataset and in-Network Transformation of CIFAR-10}
\label{chap:five}

\sect{Motivation}
In order to contextualize the results of experiments 1 and 2, we consider the methods presented there on the well-studied  CIFAR-10~\cite{krizhevsky2009learning} dataset.
CIFAR-10 is a benchmark in computer vision - since our baseline convolutional neural network is based on LeNet, we have a large body of research to compare to.
