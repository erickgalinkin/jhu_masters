I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my thesis adviser, Cleon Davis, and my co-adviser Lanier Watkins.
I have learned so much in this process and you both have been incredibly supportive. 
No matter how far out over my skis I got, they found a way to pull me back in.
I hope that in the future, I will make you both proud to call me a peer.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to both Dr. Raymond Canzanese of Netskope, who was my work supervisor during much of my time at Johns Hopkins and Mr. Derek Abdine, who is my current work supervisor and was my supervisor during the writing of this thesis.
You have both always been patient, understanding, and flexible.
Without the two of you, I would likely not be continuing on in academia after this thesis, and I will forever be in your debt.

I would like to extend my gratitude to my colleague and friend Stella Biderman for all the time she spent hearing my crazy ideas and helping me contextualize them.

Lastly, my thanks to my dearest friends Dave and Emilee; the entire Rupeethon crew (Jon, Rich, Conor, Lynn, Scott, Steve); and my friends in the DEF CON AI village (Ariel, Rich, Sven, Yaga). 
No matter how galaxy-brained I got, you always listened and kept me inspired.
