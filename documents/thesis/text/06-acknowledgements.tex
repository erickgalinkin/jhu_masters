\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my thesis adviser, Dr. Cleon Davis, and my co-adviser Dr. Lanier Watkins.
I have learned so much in this process, and you both have been incredibly supportive. 
No matter how far out over my skis I got, they found a way to pull me back in.
I hope that in the future I will make you both proud to call me a peer.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to both Dr. Raymond Canzanese of Netskope, and Mr. Derek Abdine, my two work supervisors during my time at Johns Hopkins.
You have both always been patient, understanding, and flexible.

I would like to honor my colleague and friend, Stella Biderman, for the time she spent hearing my ideas and helping me contextualize them. 
I still owe her a lot of code, and her patience is second only to her intellect.

My undying gratitude also goes to Will Pearce, who read through every line of this thesis when it was not quite ready for prime time and helped me get it into a form which I can be proud of.

Lastly, my thanks to my dearest friends Emilee Carrasquel; Gloria Cho; Dave Roberts; the entire Rupeethon crew (Jon, Ian, Rich, Conor, Lynn, Scott, Steve, Koios); and my friends in the DEF CON AI village (Ariel, Rich, Sven, Yaga, Rob, Dr. deltazero, Jason, and all the others). 
No matter how galaxy-brained I got, you always listened and kept me inspired.
Thank you all so much.
