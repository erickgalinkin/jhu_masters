As shown in Table~\ref{Tab:test}, the Random forest classifier outperforms all of the neural network and support vector machine architectures.
It is also noteworthy that the Fourier-transformed data fed to the convolutional Neural Network appears to misclassify an extremely high percentage of samples, and by flipping the labels on the test samples, we actually achieve 72.6\% accuracy, making it our second most accurate neural network classifier.
