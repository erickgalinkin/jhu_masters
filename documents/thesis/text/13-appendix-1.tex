All models were trained on the same hardware with the following specifications:
\textbf{CPU}: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2920x 12-core 3.5 GHz

\textbf{RAM}: 128 GB 3200 MHz DDR4

\textbf{GPU}: Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti 12GB

All models for which the software was compatible with GPU were trained on GPU.
Datasets were all small enough to be held in memory after having been read from disk so disk i/o latency was not a factor in training times.
